Inside the folder, you will find the notebook with the data required for it to work.
Inside each folder, there will usually be a "source" folder which will contain the code that produces the given results.

### Ex 01:
  source/main.exe expects M,N as input from command line
### Ex 02:
  source/main.exe and source/imp_sampling/main.exe expect M,N as input from command line
### Ex 03:
  Will ask for parameters once running
### Ex 04:
  Source code is in MDNVE_MCNVT folder
  Will ask for a name and use input.name as input file
### Ex 05:
  Will ask for a name once running and use name.in as input file
### Ex 06:
  Source code is in ISING_1D folder
  The program needs a name_ising.dat as input. It can read name both as command line argument and once running (if none is given as argument)
### Ex 07:
